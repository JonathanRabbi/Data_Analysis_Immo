<h2> Goal of The Analysis</h2>
The main idea behind analysing the Belgian housing market, is to grasp a better understanding concerning sustainable elements.
With a dataset of roughly 8 thousand dwellings, I was able to study whether the current property market is shifting to more energy effient standards.
Based on the analysis, it can be seen that dwellings built post the year 2000 do indeed have a more energy efficient undertone compared with older buildings.
However, these do not reflect with environmentally friendly heating condtions of the dwellings, rather stemming from a more cost effective approach.

<h3> Construction Year of Properties and its Reflective Pricing Based on Energy Class </h3>
As can be seen in the scatter plot below, there is a trend towards higher energy standards ranked between C and A+ with recent constructions, juxtapose older constructions.
Hence, by diving deeper into the type of building conditions and heating types of the properties, we will be able to view whether the Belgian housing market is adopting more environmentally friendly energy alternatives.

<h4> Heating Types </h4>
The bar chart below indicates that the majority of the houses are being heated by Gas, followed by Fossil Fuel and Electric.
Hence, an interesting aspect to consider is to see what the overall building conditions look like, as to perhaps foresee whether a large proportion of the buildings need to be renovated or are in need further refurbishments, to adopt more eco-friendly heating mechanisms.

<h4> Building Conditions </h4>
As can be seen from the scatter plot below, the majority of the properties are either 'Good'  or as 'As new'. However, there are clearly properties from the mid-twentieth century that are to-be-renovated.
This could be interesting seeing whether these to-be-renovated properties will adopt further sustainable heating types in the future.

<h4> Current Heating Types and Their Building Conditions </h4>
The stacked chart presents that the housing that are in good conditions and just renovated have a majority of Gas and Fuel as heating type, which are the least environmentally friendly though the most cost effective.
This provides us a common overview that the main heating type in the market is based more on cost efficiency vs sustaible initiatives, which will be the main energy usage for the foreceeable future.

<h4> Energy Classed Based on Their Building Conditions </h4>
An interesting aspect to view is to see whether these less eco-friendly heating types reflect in the Energy Performance Certificate.
Based on the chart below, we can see that the majority of A+ and A ratings are provided for Gas heating domiciles, though not the overwhelming majority.
We can see that the ratings are distributed quite evenly over the main heating sources from the dataset.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

Based on the above analysis, we can see that the majority of the housing market are mainly being heated by Gas and Fuels, whereas Electric is seeing a minor presence.
As the majority housing conditions are good and no fundamental requirement for any refurbishment, these heating types will be maintained for the foreseeable future.
Though the EPC ratings are more or less evenly distributed over the heating types, we can conclude that there is no clear incentive being taken towards more environmentaly friendly heating endeavors.
As properties are a significant investment, cost-effective heating conditions are still the primairy choice for new construction/refurbishment.
